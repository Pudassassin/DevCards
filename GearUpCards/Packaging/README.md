## Note from the modder
There will be more cards planned to expand in each category, this first beta release serves as a pavement and test run on my first ever modding experience, ever.

## Patch Notes
#### Public Beta 1-1 \[v0.1.9]
- Patched the logic behind the monobehavior that manages and prevents card conflicts, to execute from the main mod class instead of from each players!
- \[Shield Battery] sneak peak

#### Public Beta 1-0 \[v0.1.0]
- It all begins. Starting out with 5 wacky cards and 3 minor all-around passive cards
