# GearUP Cards [0.1.13] 
Public Release 0-1-2, build #85

Adding in game-changing mechanics into the modded ROUNDS fray! Bought to you by Pudassassin

## Cards

### Rare Cards
#### \[Anti-Bullet Magick]
Unique Magick - *Spell caster*

- *Blocking casts the spell that deletes all nearby bullets in flight and also in guns' magazines, including **yours!***

- All players affected suffer **additional 3s reload time** on top of their own guns' reload time.

**\[Magick Fragment] comes handy in helping reduce block cooldown **and** spell cooldown.*

#### \[Hollow Life]
Health Passive

- *Puffs up your total Max HP; you no longer heal as effective and to full health.
**(Stack multiplicatively)***

- Max HP is **multiplied by 3**, but also gain **-25% HP Cap** to the current health and **-15% to healing effects**. (Heals and Regens)

**Tip: Look for the cards that benefit from having larger Max HP pool, or having you to stay low on health, but definitely not \[Pristine Perserverance]!*

### Uncommon Cards
#### \[Chompy Bullet]
Bullet Passive

- *Bullets deal bonus damage based on target's current health. Effect varies with gun's firerate.\**

- This will make your gun slightly harder to shoot but will do wonder against the hearty tankers!

*The effect will spread and dilute out the more bullet you can shoot out per second

#### \[Tactical Scanner]
Block Active - *Gear equipments*

- *Blocking scans nearby players' power: Scanned enemies take more damage. Scanned friendlies heal for more.*

- Also displays a quick summary of the scanned players' combat stats.

#### \[Size Normalizer]
Unique Size Modification

- *Set your final player size much closer to default where it started.*

- For when you are going **too BEEG** or **too smol** to your liking, minor boost to health and movement speed.

### Common Cards
#### \[Medical Parts]
Health Passive - *Material*

- *Some hearty doodads to help you survive longer.*

- simply giving you +50% Health and 2 HP/s regen.

*\* Material cards can be obtained normally or as result of having conflicting cards together.*

#### \[Gun Parts]
Gun Passive - *Material*

- *Attachments and enhancements to up your gun games.*
- simply giving +25% Damage, +25% ATK SPD and +3 to Max Ammo to your gun

#### \[Magick Fragments]
Spell Passive - *Material*

- *This mysterious glyph hasten your spellcasting, but at what cost?*
- on its own, it gives -30% Block Cooldown at the cost of -25% Health.

\* *The cooldown reductions varies from each spells and Magicks*

## Note from the modder
There will be more cards planned to expand in each category, this first beta release serves as a pavement and test run on my first ever modding experience, ever.

Full details is available on my GitHub.

## Patch Notes
#### Public Beta 1-2 \[v0.1.13]
- Under the hood reworks of healing and damage multipliers.

- **\[Tactical Scanner]** now properly modify **healings** and **damages** taken and ignore all **direct health changes**.

- **\[Hollow Life]** changes:
  - rarity changed to **Rare**
  - Max HP gains changed from **x2.5** to **3x**
  - now giving **-15% healing effects**; reducing healing and regeneration

- Reduced the delay caused by card conflict resolver at the start of each round.

#### Public Beta 1-1 \[v0.1.9]
- Patched the logic behind the monobehavior that manages and prevents card conflicts, to execute from the main mod class instead of from each players!
- **\[Shield Battery]** sneak peak

#### Public Beta 1-0 \[v0.1.0]
- It all begins. Starting out with 5 wacky cards and 3 minor all-around passive cards
